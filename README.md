# Web.ControllerApi.Template

<!--[![Project banner or status badges](path-to-image-or-badge)](https://github.com/Matthew-Oduamafu/Web.ControllerApi.Template.git)-->

This project serves as a template for rapidly building ASP.NET Core APIs. It adopts a controller-centric design inspired by
default templates but extends the foundation with various practical configurations to kickstart your API development.

## Features

1. **Service Registration**: Pre-configured services to save your initial setup time.
2. **ApplicationDBContext**: Already set up to allow you to start defining and using your database entities right away.
3. **Custom API Response**: Designed to return responses in a standardized manner, making client-side handling consistent and predictable.
4. **Custom Extensions**: Built-in extensions that make common tasks easier and your codebase cleaner.
5. **Error Handling**: Robust error-handling mechanism in place to ensure graceful handling of unexpected issues.
6. **Repository Pattern**: A pre-configured repository pattern setup to encourage modular and maintainable code.

## Getting Started

- **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/Matthew-Oduamafu/Web.ControllerApi.Template.git`
- **Navigate to the project directory**: `cd Web.ControllerApi.Template`
- **Install dependencies**: `dotnet restore`
- **Run the application**: `dotnet run`
- **Install the template**: `dotnet new install .`

The API should now be running on `https://localhost:5001/` (or another assigned port).

## Configuration
